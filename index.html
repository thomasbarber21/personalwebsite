                <p>
                    My name is Tom Barber and I am from the great state of Maine. I am a recent college graduate who has a varied range of interests. As an undergraduate, I studied Applied Mathematics and Economics, which taught me a lot about problem solving and thinking outside the box. Math is a surprisingly creative field in my eyes. I am very intrigued by the relationships involved between economics and math, which persuaded me to continue my education at the Masters level in Applied Economics. Outside education, I enjoy spending time with my family, friends, and dogs. I am an avid biker, runner, and generally enjoy anything active. I also consider myself to be a music connoisseur and have a wide range of musical tastes. Most of my downtime involves watching my favorite sports teams, whether it's the Green Bay Packers, Boston Celtics, or Boston Red Sox. Go Pack Go!

                        <strong>Operations Management Intern at Amazon (June 2023 - August 2023)</strong>
                        <p>
                            This was a very unique opportunity I had to work at Amazon for the summer. I learned to coach, manage, and help develop a team of around 80 - 100 Amazon associates. While there, I worked with the upper management team to establish and maintain quality control standards. We developed performance goals and targets to achieve customer demand and ensure accuracy and quality. I also helped to maintain the standard of work and made continuous improvements through a company-assigned project. This project took ten weeks to complete and focused on optimizing a standard practice within Amazon. At the end of the ten weeks, I presented my report to upper management in an hour-long presentation. Unfortunately, due to signing an NDA, I cannot disclose my report or give more details on the process being optimized or my work.

                        <strong>Other Pertinent Experience</strong>
                        <p>
                            Throughout my time as an undergraduate, I gained key skills and experience within the classroom. Not only is my background in mathematics diverse, but I also have experience in statistics and have worked with artificial intelligence as well. My coursework includes:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mathematical Computation, Differential Equations, Complete Calculus Series</li>
                            <li>Fundamental Concepts of Math, A Proof Course</li>
                            <li>Statistics I and II</li>
                            <li>Statistical Computation</li>
                            <li>Mathematical Computation</li>
                            <li>Abstract Algebra</li>
                            <li>Microeconomics and Price Theory</li>
                            <li>Econometrics</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Such diverse coursework has helped me become familiar with Python, SQL, Microsoft Word, and Excel. I am also fluent in the statistical programming language R. In the following Projects section, I display some of the work completed using the experience I have gained. On a less technical note, I also have coursework in presentation skills and interpersonal communication. Combined with my leadership experience, I have a strong ability to work, collaborate, and communicate with others as well as manage time.

                            In this role, I was tasked with tutoring student athletes. I would then attend biweekly meetings with my supervisor and other tutors and discuss best practices, issues, and other concerns.

                    <p>
                        This econometric research used a dataset containing millions of inputs from the IPUMS database. Using R, I built linear regression models and analyzed trends between variables including gender, education, age, and region of residence. All this was used to explore the relationship between such factors and income.

                        This research project reviewed a probabilistic approach to principal component analysis and its contribution to dimensionality reduction. The project then used this concept to recreate data from the famous MNIST dataset as well as exploring simple Gaussian Mixture Models.

                        This project explored the world of data visualization in R. Specifically, I did a deep dive into both ggplot and plotly packages. I then compared both methods to the standard plotting methods in R to find the pros and cons of each method and determined when each one is best used. This project created a final product in HTML format, so I will just leave the link to it in my github here:

                    <strong>Founding Member of the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity at the University of Massachusetts Amherst</strong>
                    <p>
                        During my time at UMass, I was part of a very unique opportunity to start a new fraternity on campus. Little did I know that this opportunity would provide me with invaluable leadership skills, great friends, and the ability to do good and give back to the community. During my time in the organization, I held the positions of Public Relations Chairman, Secretary, Recruitment Chairman, and President. I also attended multiple leadership conferences all over the U.S.. During my time as President, I was fortunate enough to coordinate volunteer and philanthropy work for the organization. During my term, we volunteered for multiple families suffering from ALS and worked with various other organizations to raise money or donations for anything from children's libraries to women's shelters. My proudest work, however, was working directly with an international nonprofit called the LivLikeLou Foundation. With this foundation, we worked closely with ALS families and raised money for research towards a cure. Our most successful fundraiser grossed close to $700 in about 10 hours. Such work led my fraternity to two national awards from our General Headquarters, all while we maintained a top-four average GPA among our members for every semester I was involved. This is by far one of my proudest achievements.

            <p>
                Did you know that humans are notoriously bad at randomness? In fact, if a population sample is large enough, humans have major errors in picking a random number from 1 - 10. Guess a number from 1 - 10 and hit the button below to see if you and your computer are on the same wavelength. I will say though, in large groups humans have an odd attraction to the number 7...
